Feature: As a student, I would like to identify a triangle based on the length of three sides input that is out ofrange

Background:
	Give I am a geometry student

	Scenario Outline: Normal Flow
	  I would like to identify a if it is triangle based on the length of three sides

	  Given length of side A is <SIDEA>
	  And the length of side B is <SIDEB>
	  And the length of side C is <SIDEC> which is out of range
	  When I request the triangle type
	  I will be informed that it is an invalid type with <message>


		Examples:
			|    SIDEA |    SIDEB      |  SIDEC  |   message      |
			|    2     |    40         |  -1     |   Invalid type |
			|    4     |    2          |  0      |   Invalid type |
			|    2     |    2          |  199    |   Invalid type |

			|    4     |    0          |  2      |   Invalid type |

  Scenario Outline: Error Flow
    I would like to identify a if it is a triangle based on the length of three sides but i only enter two sides

    Given length of side A is <SIDEA>
    And the length of side B is <SIDEB> is out of range
    When I request the triangle type
    Then I should get a error message "<error>"


  	Examples:
  		|    SIDEA |    SIDEB      |     error                    |
  		|    40    |    -1         |     Please enter three sides |
  		|    2     |    0          |     Please enter three sides |
  		|    2     |    199        |     Please enter three sides |
